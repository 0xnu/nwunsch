[Needlemanâ€“Wunsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) algorithm implementation in Go.

### Features

- **Sequence Comparison**: The package enables the comparison of two sequences (seq1 and seq2) by considering all possible alignments and choosing the best one.

- **Scoring System**: The scoring system is customisable with match, mismatch, and gap parameters, allowing users to define the reward for matched characters and penalties for mismatches and gaps.

- **Matrix Generation and Population**: It creates a dynamic programming matrix of sequence lengths and populates it accordingly based on optimal alignment values.

- **Traceback Functionality**: It includes a traceback procedure which identifies the optimal path through the matrix, producing the final alignment of the input sequences.

- **Efficient Evaluation**: It utilises a max function to determine the maximum score between match, mismatch, and gap; this feature guarantees the efficiency of the sequence alignment process.
